        <h1>Palak, very simplified.</h1>
        <p>This is a simple vegetarian recipe that helped me a lot when I first started cutting down on meat. My version is a very, VERY, simplified version for when you do not want to spend too much time cooking but still want something nutritious and delicious.</p>
