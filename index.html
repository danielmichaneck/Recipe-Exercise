                <p class="recipe-text">This is a simple vegetarian recipe that helped me a lot when I first started cutting down on meat. My version is a very, VERY, simplified version for when you do not want to spend too much time cooking but still want something nutritious and delicious.</p>

                <h2>What is Palak?</h2>
                <p class="recipe-text">Palak is an indian dish with different variations. Some use paneer, some use lentils, and many have spinach in them. Usually, the spinach is made into a puré or paste, but in this recipe we will be adding whole leaves.
                    This recipe also uses lentils so if they are not to your taste, check out another version of the dish!</p>

                <section class="recipe-block">
                    <ul>
                        <li>2.5 dl Bulgur.</li>
                        <li>1 Onion</li>
                        <li>3 Garlic cloves (or as many as your heart desires!).</li>
                        <li>400 grams Crushed tomatoes.</li>
                        <li>1.5 dl Red lentils.</li>
                        <li>2.5 dl Cream/Coconut milk/Cheese or whatever you have at home that will add a bit of thickness to it.</li>
                        <li>2.5 dl Water.</li>
                        <li>100 grams Spinach.</li>
                        <li>2 table spoons Freshly cut ginger.</li>
                        <li>2 table spoons Garam masala.</li>
                        <li>2 tea spoons Black pepper.</li>
                        <li>2 tea spoons Turmeric.</li>
                        <li>1 tea spoon Cumin.</li>

                    </ul>

                        <li>Start by chopping up the onion, garlic, and ginger.</li>
                        <li>Put the onion and garlic into a pot. Pour a thin layer of cooking oil into the pot and set it to medium heat. Make sure to stir occasionally so that the onion does not get burnt.</li>
                        <li>Start boiling water in another pot and then add the bulgur. Cook it as you would normally.</li>
                        <li>Prepare the spices by putting them on a plate or in a bowl.</li>
                        <img src="andy-holmes-mTqGgeYkfaY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Image of spices in a bowl."  class="image-split">
                        <li>Once the onion and garlic are almost done push them to the side to make room for the spices. Pour the spices into the oil and stir them around so that they get soaked in the oil. Let them fry together with the onion and garlic for a minute.</li>
                        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, lentils, water, ginger, and cream or similar substitute. A tip is to pour the water into one of the containers to get the last bit of tomatoes or cream out. Stir the pot so that there is an even distribution of the ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Bring it to a boil and then lower the temperature a bit and let it cook under a lid for about 18 minutes.</li>
                        <li>The dish is done when the consistency of the dish is less liquidy and more creamy.</li>
                        <li>Before serving, add the spinach leaves and stir around the pot. If you are planning on keeping some for another meal I recommend that you do not add the spinach leaves directly to the pot and instead add them when you serve the dish. The spinach leaves do not do well in the fridge after being cooked!</li>
                        <li>Serve together with the bulgur and enjoy a health and tasty vegetarian meal!</li>
